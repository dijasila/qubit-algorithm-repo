# Qubit Algorithm Repository

This repository contains implementations of quantum algorithms, specifically Grover's algorithm, along with utilities for visualizing results.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains any sample data (if applicable).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for documenting the algorithm analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for the quantum algorithms.
  - `algorithms/`: Contains quantum algorithm implementations.
  - `utils/`: Contains utility functions for visualization.
- `docs/`: Contains generated visualizations.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages: `pip install qiskit matplotlib`
3. Run the scripts in the following order:
   - Execute the Grover algorithm: `python src/algorithms/quantum_grover.py`
   - Visualize the results: `python src/utils/visualize_results.py`
